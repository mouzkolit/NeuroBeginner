    "## What is Conditioning\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditioning allows us to evaluate certain conditions of variables e.g. We can check if a list is of certain length, or if the first number in the list is equal to 0, or if a variable exists or is in a None state (basically you can check everything you can imagine). It is important that each if statement opens a new block, which can consist of one if statement, multiple elifs statements and one else statement. If you have just one condition to check than also only one if statement would be enough. But be aware using multiple if statements instead of elifs will execute each if statement if true. By contrast using if elif else will ensure that only the condition that is evaluated as True will be executed. An example for this is provided below underneath general conditioning. In addition conditioning can be used for every available data structure and data types such as ints, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, arrays and general object created on your own."
